* [Big O Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

* Greedy Algorithm: 
builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
[Problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
1. base case 
2. sort / break up problems by steps 
3. ways to optimize the solution
